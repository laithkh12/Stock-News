# üìà Stock Price Notification System üì≤

A Python application that monitors stock price fluctuations for Tesla (TSLA) and sends news updates via SMS when a significant price change occurs.

## üìú Overview

This project uses **Alphavantage API** to get the latest stock price data, **News API** to retrieve recent news articles about Tesla, and **Twilio** to send SMS alerts. If Tesla's stock price changes by more than 5% from the previous day, the application sends an SMS with the latest news headlines related to Tesla.

## üìÑ How It Works
### Step 1: Fetch Stock Price Data
The program retrieves the closing stock prices for TSLA over the last two days.
```python
stockParams = {
    'function': 'TIME_SERIES_DAILY',
    'symbol': STOCK_NAME,
    'apikey': STOCK_API_KEY
}

response = requests.get(STOCK_ENDPOINT, params=stockParams)
data = response.json()["Time Series (Daily)"]
```
### Step 2: Calculate Percentage Change
It then calculates the percentage difference between the two most recent closing prices.
```python
difference = float(yesterdayClosingPrice) - float(dayBeforeYesterdayClosingPrice)
diffPercent = round((difference / float(yesterdayClosingPrice)) * 100)
```
### Step 3: Fetch News Articles
If the percentage change exceeds the threshold, the program fetches the top three news articles about Tesla.
```python
newsParams = {
    'apikey': NEWS_API_KEY,
    "qInTitle": COMPANY_NAME,
}
newsResponse = requests.get(NEWS_ENDPOINT, params=newsParams)
```
### Step 4: Send SMS Alerts
Each news article is formatted and sent as an SMS message to the specified phone number.
```python
client = Client(TWILIO_SID, TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN)
for article in formattedArticles:
    message = client.messages.create(body=article, from_=FROM_PHONE, to=TO_PHONE)
```

## üîê Security
Make sure to exclude your .env file from version control to keep your API keys and credentials secure.
